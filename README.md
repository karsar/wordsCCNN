## Usage
To repeat computational experiments:

1) For the palindrome case, use the 'palindromes.zip' dataset and unpack it into the same directory as 'palindromeCCN.ipynb'.

2) For the password case, use the 'passwords.zip' dataset and unpack it into the same directory as 'passwordsCCNN.ipynb'. Also, copy 'goodpasswords.txt' and 'badpasswords.txt' into the same directory.

The code for generating palindromes ('palindromes.zip') is in 'GeneratePalindromes.ipynb'.

The code for generating non-palindromes ('palindromes.zip') is in 'GenerateNonPalindromes.ipynb'

The code for generating passwords is in 'GeneratePasswords.ipynb'.

Correspondingly, LSTM-based experiments for palindromes and passwords are RNNpalindrome.ipynb and RNNpasswords.ipynb

CNN-based experiments for palindromes and passwords are ConvPalindrome.ipynb and ConvPasswords.ipynb.

passwords.zip and palindromes.zip are available at [https://osf.io/qfhcy/](https://osf.io/qfhcy/?view_only=dc5b9d0639c74849a19a5da750531452)
